Social Prescribing

Social prescribing is when health care professionals refer patients to community services and resources to help improve their physical and or mental wellbeing. This social prescription project is a website where a user can search for resources in their area by zip code, and sort those results by category. Site users can also save their favorite results to refer back to them at a later time.
