Social Prescribing

Social prescribing is when health care professionals refer patients to community services and resources to help improve their physical and or mental wellbeing. This social prescription project is a website where a user can search for resources in their area by zip code, and sort those results by category. Site users can also save their favorite results to refer back to them at a later time.

Development Process

This product was developed using multiple tools. Once scoped, event based websites were selected based on their API functions and the needs of the product to be the sites data results are pulled from. The front end of the site was created using React, and Firebase was used to help connect the front end to the database entries. AWS was then set up so that the Postgres database could be made. During this time the code was updated to reflect the major changes to Firebase’s documentation. Routes were then updated to improve functionality, and the ability to save favorite results was added. 

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Project Set-up

Run: `npm install` in the main folder and the `client` folder to install necessary dependencies. 

Run: `npm run dev` in the development  to start up the project after installation.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
